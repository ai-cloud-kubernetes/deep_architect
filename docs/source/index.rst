DeepArchitect: A Framework for Architecture Search
==================================================

DeepArchitect is a framework for architecture search in arbitrary domains.
DeepArchitect
was designed with a focus on **modularity**, **ease of use**,
**reusability**, and **extensibility**.
With DeepArchitect, we aim to impact the workflows of
both researchers and practitioners by reducing the burden resulting from
the large number of arbitrary choices that have to be made to design
deep learning models.
We recommend the reader to start with the :doc:`overview <readme>`,
tutorials
(e.g., :doc:`here <tutorials/search_space_constructs>`)
and simple examples
(e.g., `here <https://github.com/negrinho/darch/blob/master/examples/mnist_with_logging/main.py>`_)
to get a gist of the framework.

Questions and bug reports should be done through Github issues.
See :doc:`here <contributing>` for details on how to contribute.
