This folder contains the code to run architecture search using Kubernetes and a
MongoDB database as a communicator between processes. The searches were run on
Google Kubernetes Engine using TPUs.

The following is a description of the files:
    - dockerfiles/DOCKERFILE
        The dockerfile setting up the container that is created and run by each
        Kubernetes pod. It sets up all of the necessary prerequisites necessary
        to run DeepArchitect.
    - master.py
        Contains the code that is run by the master/searcher process.
    - train_best_master.py
        Contains the code that is run by the master when training the best
        architectures found by an architecture search to completion.
    - worker.py
        Contains the code that is run by the worker/evaluator processes.
    - search_space_factory.py
        Contains a reference to every search space used in this example.
    - searcher.py
        Contains a reference to every searcher used in this example.
    - experiment_config.json
        Config file for architecture searches.
    - train_best_config.json
        Config file for when training the best architectures found by an
        architecture search to completion.
    - master.yaml
        Job spec for master/searcher job.
    - train_best_master.yaml
        Job spec for master job when training the best architectures found by
        an architecture search to completion.
    - worker_permanent.yaml
        Job spec for worker job. Uses permanent TPUs.
    - worker_preemptible.yaml
        Job spec for worker job. Uses preemptible TPUs.
